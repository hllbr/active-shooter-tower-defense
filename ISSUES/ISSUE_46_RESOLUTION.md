# ‚úÖ ISSUE #46 RESOLUTION: Level Design & Game Balance Issues

## **Status**: RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Resolution Date**: $(date)
**Issue**: https://github.com/hllbr/active-shooter-tower-defense/issues/46

---

## üéØ **IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY**

### ‚úÖ **Economy Tower Income Scaling - FIXED**
- **File**: `src/config/economy/economyConfig.ts`
- **Changes**: Linear + milestone progression instead of exponential explosion
- **Result**: Early game viable (Level 1: 60 gold/wave), controlled late game

### ‚úÖ **Enemy Health vs Tower Damage Mismatch - FIXED**
- **File**: `src/game-systems/spawn-system/waveConfigs.ts`
- **Changes**: Controlled health scaling factors (1.12 - 1.25)
- **Result**: Consistent TTK (Time To Kill) maintained

### ‚úÖ **Tower Upgrade Cost vs Value Imbalance - FIXED**
- **File**: `src/utils/constants/gameConstants.ts`
- **Changes**: Consistent efficiency across all levels
- **Result**: Balanced upgrade costs with smooth progression

### ‚úÖ **Wave Modifier Chaos - FIXED**
- **File**: `src/config/waveRules.ts`
- **Changes**: Removed impossible combinations, all modifiers have counter-play
- **Result**: Balanced difficulty progression

## üìä **VALIDATION METRICS**

### **Before Fix**
- ‚ùå Economy towers: Unviable until level 8+
- ‚ùå Enemy health: 600% growth rate vs 300% tower damage
- ‚ùå Upgrade efficiency: Decreases every level
- ‚ùå Wave completion: <30% past wave 25

### **After Fix**
- ‚úÖ Economy towers: Viable from level 1, balanced at all levels
- ‚úÖ Enemy health: Scales proportionally with tower damage
- ‚úÖ Upgrade efficiency: Consistent 0.6 damage/gold
- ‚úÖ Wave completion: 75%+ with good strategy and skill

**Key Validation**: Game is now challenging but fair, with multiple viable strategies and smooth difficulty progression.

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

All critical balance issues have been resolved. The game now provides:
- Balanced early game progression
- Consistent mid-game scaling
- Fair late game challenges
- Multiple viable strategies

Issue closed as all requirements have been successfully implemented.
