## üé≠ **ANIMATION IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **Phase 1: Core Combat Animations (1 hafta)**
```typescript
phase1Priority = [
  "Tower build/destroy animations",
  "Bullet firing and impact effects", 
  "Enemy damage feedback",
  "Basic UI feedback animations",
  "Energy system visualization"
];
```

### **Phase 2: UI & Polish Animations (1 hafta)**
```typescript
phase2Priority = [
  "Command Center panel animations",
  "Upgrade screen enhanced feedback",
  "Achievement unlock celebrations",
  "Resource counter animations",
  "Wave transition effects"
];
```

### **Phase 3: Advanced Effects (1 hafta)**
```typescript
phase3Priority = [
  "Particle systems implementation",
  "Boss encounter animations",
  "Victory/defeat sequences",
  "Weather and environmental effects",
  "Mobile optimizations"

## üõ†Ô∏è **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Recommended Libraries**
```typescript
animationLibraries = {
  framer_motion: {
    pros: "React native, declarative, spring animations",
    use_cases: "UI animations, page transitions",
    bundle_size: "~50KB"
