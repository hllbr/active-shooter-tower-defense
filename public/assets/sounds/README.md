# 🔊 Audio System - Sound Files

## ✅ **Available Sounds**
- `gameover.wav` - Game defeat sound (610KB)
- `gamesound.wav` - Background music (7.6MB)
- `levelupwav.wav` - Level up / achievement sound (190KB)
- `lock-break.wav` - Unlock / purchase sound (198KB)

## ❌ **Missing Sounds** (Critical for Audio System Fix)

### Victory & Feedback Sounds
- `victory.wav` - Victory celebration (when completing all 100 waves)
- `warning.wav` - Preparation countdown warning
- `purchase.wav` - Upgrade purchase feedback  
- `click.wav` - UI click feedback

### Temporary Workarounds
Until missing sounds are added:
- `victory` context → plays `levelupwav.wav` (celebration)
- `warning` context → plays `gameover.wav` (attention)
- `purchase` context → plays `lock-break.wav` (transaction)
- `click` context → silent (no audio feedback)

## 🎯 **Sound Context Mapping**
```typescript
victory: 'levelupwav',    // Celebration sound for victory
defeat: 'gameover',       // Defeat sound 
warning: 'gameover',      // Warning sound (temp)
purchase: 'lock-break',   // Purchase feedback
click: '',                // Silent until added
unlock: 'lock-break'      // Slot/upgrade unlock
```

## 📝 **Audio Quality Requirements**
- **Format**: WAV preferred (better quality, instant load)
- **Volume**: Normalized to prevent ear damage
- **Length**: 
  - Sound effects: 0.5-3 seconds
  - Background music: 30-120 seconds (looped)
- **Bitrate**: 16-bit 44.1kHz standard

## 🔧 **Integration Status**
- ✅ Smart Music Manager implemented (prevents overlaps)
- ✅ Context-aware sound system implemented  
- ✅ Missing sound detection implemented
- ✅ Immediate game over sound (no delay)
- ✅ Victory vs defeat sound logic implemented
