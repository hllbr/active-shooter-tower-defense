## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **1. Component Interconnection Validator**

**Core System**: `ComponentInterconnectionValidator.ts`

The validator provides comprehensive testing of system interconnections:

```typescript
export class ComponentInterconnectionValidator {
  // Test scenarios for different game phases
  private testScenarios: TestScenario[] = [
    {
      name: 'Early Game Mission Integration',
      waveRange: [1, 10],
      tests: [
        { name: 'Mission Gold Reward', test: () => this.testMissionGoldReward() },
        { name: 'Mission Energy Reward', test: () => this.testMissionEnergyReward() },
        { name: 'Mission Upgrade Reward', test: () => this.testMissionUpgradeReward() }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'Mid Game System Integration',
      waveRange: [11, 50],
      tests: [
        { name: 'Energy Cost Validation', test: () => this.testEnergyCostValidation() },
        { name: 'Upgrade Mission Sync', test: () => this.testUpgradeMissionSync() },
        { name: 'Gold Economy Balance', test: () => this.testGoldEconomyBalance() }
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'Late Game Progression Stability',
      waveRange: [51, 100],
      tests: [
        { name: 'High Wave Performance', test: () => this.testHighWavePerformance() },
        { name: 'Resource Scaling', test: () => this.testResourceScaling() },
        { name: 'Mission Chain Stability', test: () => this.testMissionChainStability() }
      ]
    }
  ];
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **9 Comprehensive Test Scenarios** covering all game phases
- **Real-time System Testing** with actual store interactions
- **Performance Metrics** including response time and memory usage
- **Detailed Reporting** with pass/fail rates and error details

### **2. Gameplay Loop Tester**

**Core System**: `GameplayLoopTester.ts`

The gameplay tester validates the full progression from early to late waves:

```typescript
export class GameplayLoopTester {
  async runFullGameplayTest(): Promise<GameplayTestReport> {
    // Phase 1: Early Game (Waves 1-10)
    await this.testEarlyGamePhase(report);
    
    // Phase 2: Mid Game (Waves 11-50)
    await this.testMidGamePhase(report);
    
    // Phase 3: Late Game (Waves 51-100)
    await this.testLateGamePhase(report);
    
    // Phase 4: System Integration Validation
    await this.testSystemIntegration(report);
    
    // Phase 5: Performance and Stability
    await this.testPerformanceAndStability(report);
  }
}
```

**Test Phases**:
- **Early Game**: Game initialization, first wave mechanics, basic mission system, early upgrades, energy basics
- **Mid Game**: Wave progression, mission chain stability, upgrade integration, energy management, economy balance
- **Late Game**: High wave performance, resource scaling, advanced missions, complex upgrades, system stress
- **System Integration**: Component interconnection, cross-system communication, data consistency
- **Performance**: Memory usage, frame rate stability, long-term stability

### **3. Main Validation Runner**

**Core System**: `ValidationRunner.ts`

The main runner combines all validation systems into a comprehensive interface:

```typescript
export class ValidationRunner {
  async runFullValidation(): Promise<FullValidationReport> {
    // Step 1: Component Interconnection Validation
    report.componentValidation = await componentValidator.runFullValidation();
    
    // Step 2: Gameplay Loop Testing
    report.gameplayValidation = await gameplayTester.runFullGameplayTest();
    
    // Step 3: Cross-System Integration Tests
    report.crossSystemTests = await this.runCrossSystemTests();
    
    // Step 4: Performance and Stability Tests
    report.performanceTests = await this.runPerformanceTests();
  }
}
```

**Validation Types**:
- **Full Validation**: Complete system testing (recommended for thorough validation)
